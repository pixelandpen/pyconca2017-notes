## Camille Fourmier - Building Engaged Communities

- technology is always about change
- Camille's book is "The Manager's Path" (O'Reilly) - http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do
- she noted throughout the talk the parallels between Python's vision and the factors it takes to build engaged communities

### What do engineer's want? i.e. factors of engagement

- Rewards
  - economic (i.e. $$)
  - feedback, learning and growth
  - speed and frequency of deployments ("Engineers like to ship!")
    - this is especially important for commitment and engagement
- Feeling of respect 
  - pyschological safety; able to make mistakes, ask questions and be vulnerable
  - relatedness - feeling of kinship, friendship and community
  - empathy - this is a learnable skill - i.e. you can fake sincerity =)
    - "where attention goes, energy flows" - i.e. if you start expressing interest in others, you will actually start caring about them
  - partnership - cross functional teams; expand community beyond "code"
- Sense of purpose
  - ask "why?" - need mission/vision - why THIS project?
  - ask "why this?" - what is the point of the work I'm doing right now?
    - helps them take ownership by breaking down grand vision into smaller chunks
  - ask "what next?" - i.e. how to decide where we're going? and how do I get involved in that process?
    - this requires the leader to give up some control - but allows the whole team to have ownership and opinions, and to set the roadmap

## Craig Kerstiens - PostgreSQL at Scale

- http://www.craigkerstiens.com/
- Reasons to adopt Postgres
  - GIS compatibilities
  - many datatypes
  - many index types
  - full text search
  - JSONB vs JSON
- REMINDER: backups don't exist unless they are tested!
  - pg_dump - for logical backup - for small projects
  - barman, wal-e/wal-g - for physical backup - for large projects

### Depending on the scale, things to be mindful of

#### Small scale

- use timestamptz rather than timestamp
- use constraints - referential integrity
- psqlrc file - to create custom settings 
  - e.g. \x auto, \timing, saving history, etc.

#### Medium scale

- tune psql and server
  - can use something like http://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/ to help with suggested settings
- determine the 'cache hit rate' - should be >= 99%
- determine the 'index hit rate' - should be >= 95%
- see Craig's post at http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/10/01/understanding-postgres-performance/ for SQL to calculate these
- use EXPLAIN ANALYZE on queries - aim for <100 ms
- SELECT * pg_stat_statements - records all queries
- BTree index is preferred index type 99% of time
  - use GIN for JSONB or if have multiple values in single column
  - use GIST for full text search and shapes
- drop unused indexes
- during a db migration, need to deal with NOT NULL values for records because they will need to be rewritten

#### Large scale

- add connection pooler - eg. pgBouncer or pgpool
  - add pooler beginning at about 100 connections
- when you have maxed out caching, offload read functionality to replication
- can use sharding to split up large tables
- can use product like Citus (https://www.citusdata.com/product) - extends PostgreSQL to run multiple db's under the hood but only show one database

## Jack Diederich - HOWTO write a function

- function structure:
  - input - throw out what not needed; validation and asserts
  - transform - exceptions should be exceptional at this stage
  - output - there should be no exceptions at this point
- can 'return' early to help the code reader
  - but also be sure to be consistent in returning i.e. what datatype is returned
- define things next to where they are used
  - i.e. don't have globals/constants if local defined var is fine
  - use Python's built-in RuntimeError rather than custom Exceptions
- names have meaning, so be careful
- "linters are attractive nuisances" - i.e. developer can start coding to please the linter; leads to wasted effort
- "language features are attractive nuisances" - don't overuse them
- beware of "cargo culting" - i.e. follow some fad in coding that makes no sense - e.g. code that does not have if/elif 

## Robyn Allen - Teaching Python to Teens

- speaks to students as fellow engineers
- asks them to examine two short essays and then determine how a computer could grade them
- works on skills progress - vars, dtypes, lists, loops
- see https://github.com/stackmaps/astronauts for training materials
  - checkout 'teaching_resources' branch for PDFs, etc.
- the practices of effective problem solvers:
  - inquires with curiosity
  - does math fearlessly
  - employs self-talk - "I can do this!"
  - thinks open source
- Robyn's goal is to create community that is working on open source curriculum 

## Ruth Grace Wong - Flamegraph That

- see http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html
- their team's usage of flamegraphs has encouraged profiling of services by devs and improved efficiency
  - can see the bottlenecks / problem areas in the code execution
- does not work for analyzing containers because function names are incorrect

## Christian Hudon - Pandas and scikit-learn

- scikit-learn is machine learning tool in python (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/#)
- Christian converted Pandas dataframes to numpy arrays in order to use in SKL

## Niall Byrne - Dockerized Dev Environments

- only covered dev, not production, in this talk
- advantages of Dockerized environments:
  - manage dependencies
  - compartmentalization - i.e. "one process per container" philosophy
    - the containers can be versioned
  - container ecosystem - can model a cloud setup using Docker's network

## enzyme - Find the Farm

- used Jupyter Notebooks to look at data clustering re: effect of a realtor on sales
- some tools he used:
  - geopy - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy
  - scipy - https://www.scipy.org/
  - gmplot - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmplot/1.0.5
  - geojson.io - http://geojson.io

## Anton Lodder - Make ASCII not war

- dev for Opus One Solutions - software for analyzing power grids
- use CIM (XML-based language) - but very verbose
- therefore created ascii-cim (based off asciigraf graph parser) to use docstring to represent diagram

## Devon Barnard - Effective package management

- intra-package
  - config files - can be nsted; can have testing vs production settings
  - app factories
  - package versioning (setup.py); changelogs (see PEP440) - can use testpypi.python.org risk-free
- inter-package
  - requirements.txt
  - pip supports cloning over git, git+https, and git+ssh
  - use virtualenv to manage package versions - instead of global scope pip install

## Joe Gordon - Python profiling and performance tuning in production

- works for Pinterest
- event-based profilers
  - API Profiler - for dev use only - large overhead
  - Python pstats module - for callees and callers
  - line profiling - see rkern's line_profiler project on GitHub
- statistics profilers
  - flamegraphs - can diff two flamegraphs to see what happened
  - can run in production
  - see nylas_perftools or vmprof-python projects

## Keynote: Julia Evans - So you want to be a wizard

- @b0rk or http://jvns.ca
- discussed fixed mindset vs growth mindset
- wizard skills:
  1. understand abstractions
    - understanding interface vs understanding everything below interface
    - would look below interface to debug hard problems, push limits of performance, or innovate
    - build something from scratch to learn
    - read thing that are too hard - e.g. jepsen.io for db analysis posts
  2. ask great questions
    - when asking, start with what you do know and then ask something that's easy to answer and gets info you need
    - be specific when asking about big systems
    - can guess the answer then ask the question
    - ask in public (especially for senior devs)
  3. read the code
    - for small codebase, read it all
    - for large codebase, read based on specific question e.g. grep for UI tests
    - exploratory refactoring - but then put the code back the way you found it
  4. debugging
    - see Allison Kaptur "Love your bugs" blog post
    - learn where your mental models are wrong 
    - debugging makes you better at writing reliable code
    - remember that the bug happened for a logical reason
    - train your intuitions e.g. is the particular performance slow/fast
      - e.g. computers-are-fast.github.io for some benchmarks
  5. design and iterate
    - planning - keep track of 'why?' - ensure team on same page
    - start by designing small projects
    - write the product/application launch announcement first
      - why it is important
      - what you did
      - how you know it's working
    - write a "premortem" - like a business case of failed project
    - make a proof of concept
    - your first design won't (shouldn't) be perfect
    - a person who knows everything doesn't exist - YOU are the person who IS available!
    - do hard projects
