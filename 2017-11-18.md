## Camille Fourmier - Building Engaged Communities

- technology is always about change
- Camille's book is "The Manager's Path" (O'Reilly) - http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do
- she noted throughout the talk the parallels between Python's vision and the factors it takes to build engaged communities

### What do engineer's want? i.e. factors of engagement

- Rewards
  - economic (i.e. $$)
  - feedback, learning and growth
  - speed and frequency of deployments ("Engineers like to ship!")
    - this is especially important for commitment and engagement
- Feeling of respect 
  - pyschological safety; able to make mistakes, ask questions and be vulnerable
  - relatedness - feeling of kinship, friendship and community
  - empathy - this is a learnable skill - i.e. you can fake sincerity =)
    - "where attention goes, energy flows" - i.e. if you start expressing interest in others, you will actually start caring about them
  - partnership - cross functional teams; expand community beyond "code"
- Sense of purpose
  - ask "why?" - need mission/vision - why THIS project?
  - ask "why this?" - what is the point of the work I'm doing right now?
    - helps them take ownership by breaking down grand vision into smaller chunks
  - ask "what next?" - i.e. how to decide where we're going? and how do I get involved in that process?
    - this requires the leader to give up some control - but allows the whole team to have ownership and opinions, and to set the roadmap

## Craig Kerstiens - PostgreSQL at Scale

- http://www.craigkerstiens.com/
- Reasons to adopt Postgres
  - GIS compatibilities
  - many datatypes
  - many index types
  - full text search
  - JSONB vs JSON
- REMINDER: backups don't exist unless they are tested!
  - pg_dump - for logical backup - for small projects
  - barman, wal-e/wal-g - for physical backup - for large projects

### Depending on the scale, things to be mindful of

#### Small scale

- use timestamptz rather than timestamp
- use constraints - referential integrity
- psqlrc file - to create custom settings 
  - e.g. \x auto, \timing, saving history, etc.

#### Medium scale

- tune psql and server
  - can use something like http://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/ to help with suggested settings
- determine the 'cache hit rate' - should be >= 99%
- determine the 'index hit rate' - should be >= 95%
- see Craig's post at http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/10/01/understanding-postgres-performance/ for SQL to calculate these
- use EXPLAIN ANALYZE on queries - aim for <100 ms
- SELECT * pg_stat_statements - records all queries
- BTree index is preferred index type 99% of time
  - use GIN for JSONB or if have multiple values in single column
  - use GIST for full text search and shapes
- drop unused indexes
- during a db migration, need to deal with NOT NULL values for records because they will need to be rewritten

#### Large scale

- add connection pooler - eg. pgBouncer or pgpool
  - add pooler beginning at about 100 connections
- when you have maxed out caching, offload read functionality to replication
- can use sharding to split up large tables
- can use product like Citus (https://www.citusdata.com/product) - extends PostgreSQL to run multiple db's under the hood but only show one database

## Jack Diederich - HOWTO write a function

- function structure:
  - input - throw out what not needed; validation and asserts
  - transform - exceptions should be exceptional at this stage
  - output - there should be no exceptions at this point
- can 'return' early to help the code reader
  - but also be sure to be consistent in returning i.e. what datatype is returned
- define things next to where they are used
  - i.e. don't have globals/constants if local defined var is fine
  - use Python's built-in RuntimeError rather than custom Exceptions
- names have meaning, so be careful
- "linters are attractive nuisances" - i.e. developer can start coding to please the linter; leads to wasted effort
- "language features are attractive nuisances" - don't overuse them
- beware of "cargo culting" - i.e. follow some fad in coding that makes no sense - e.g. code that does not have if/elif 

## Robyn Allen - Teaching Python to Teens

- speaks to students as fellow engineers
- asks them to examine two short essays and then determine how a computer could grade them
- works on skills progress - vars, dtypes, lists, loops
- see https://github.com/stackmaps/astronauts for training materials
  - checkout 'teaching_resources' branch for PDFs, etc.
- the practices of effective problem solvers:
  - inquires with curiosity
  - does math fearlessly
  - employs self-talk - "I can do this!"
  - thinks open source
- Robyn's goal is to create community that is working on open source curriculum 

## Ruth Grace Wong - Flamegraph That

- see http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html
- their team's usage of flamegraphs has encouraged profiling of services by devs and improved efficiency
  - can see the bottlenecks / problem areas in the code execution
- does not work for analyzing containers because function names are incorrect

## Christian Hudon - Pandas and scikit-learn

- scikit-learn is machine learning tool in python (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/#)
- Christian converted Pandas dataframes to numpy arrays in order to use in SKL

## Niall Byrne - Dockerized Dev Environments

- only covered dev, not production, in this talk
- advantages of Dockerized environments:
  - manage dependencies
  - compartmentalization - i.e. "one process per container" philosophy
    - the containers can be versioned
  - container ecosystem - can model a cloud setup using Docker's network

## enzyme - Find the Farm

- used Jupyter Notebooks to look at data clustering re: effect of a realtor on sales
- some tools he used:
  - geopy - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy
  - scipy - https://www.scipy.org/
  - gmplot - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmplot/1.0.5
  - geojson.io - http://geojson.io
