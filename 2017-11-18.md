## Camille Fourmier - Building Engaged Communities

- technology is always about change
- Camille's book is "The Manager's Path" (O'Reilly) - http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do
- she noted throughout the talk the parallels between Python's vision and the factors it takes to build engaged communities

### What do engineer's want? i.e. factors of engagement

- Rewards
  - economic (i.e. $$)
  - feedback, learning and growth
  - speed and frequency of deployments ("Engineers like to ship!")
    - this is especially important for commitment and engagement
- Feeling of respect 
  - pyschological safety; able to make mistakes, ask questions and be vulnerable
  - relatedness - feeling of kinship, friendship and community
  - empathy - this is a learnable skill - i.e. you can fake sincerity =)
    - "where attention goes, energy flows" - i.e. if you start expressing interest in others, you will actually start caring about them
  - partnership - cross functional teams; expand community beyond "code"
- Sense of purpose
  - ask "why?" - need mission/vision - why THIS project?
  - ask "why this?" - what is the point of the work I'm doing right now?
    - helps them take ownership by breaking down grand vision into smaller chunks
  - ask "what next?" - i.e. how to decide where we're going? and how do I get involved in that process?
    - this requires the leader to give up some control - but allows the whole team to have ownership and opinions, and to set the roadmap
