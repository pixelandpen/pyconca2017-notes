## Keynote: Lynn Root - How to spy with Python

- started with history of spying and intelligence sharing by governments 
- why it matters:
  - privacy
  - security
  - metadata reveals things
- how to spy:
  - scapy - packet sniffer
  - pygeoip - get GPS coordinates
  - python-geojson - for mapping coordinates
  - python-nmap - for port scanning

## Jaron Chong - Deep Learning 

- Geoff Hinton - predicted that AI/deep learning will put radiologists out of business
- DICOM - digital imaging standard from 1985 (predates JPG)
- uses deep learning for scanning xrays at McGill Hospital
- also need AI in whole radiology workflow
- there are many 'wicked problems' in healthcare
- healthcare needs more labeled datasets to assist machine learning
- the speed of AI needs to be fast because 100s of images per patients, with dozen of patients daily
- in healthcare, privacy is of supreme importance

## Jacob Cook - Django and React

- JavaScript important for modern web 
  - modern JS frameworks means can do JS in more structured way
- there are many pythonic features in ES6
- React has:
  - properties (model)
  - states
  - components
- In React, single page app approach is most common - uses AJAX to contact view
- webpack - asset bundler; model transpiler

## Rob Van Gennip - Structured logging in Python

- logging module in Python - classes:
  - logger - setup instance
  - handler - sends records to destination
  - filter - determine what gets logged
  - formatter - JSON formatter is available
- can create a data dictionary to pass to logger config
  - i.e. can add custom info to each entry, such as user id
- structured logging - record key/value pairs (this is where JSON helpful)
- suggested ELK stack (Elastic Search, Logstash, and Kibana)
- tips for logging:
  - human readable - use key/value pairs
  - include extra context data as necessary e.g. user id
  - be concise but descriptive

## Matthew Mirvish - School homework

- created own 3D rendering engine, including own scripting language, as part of assignment in elementary school

## Jonathan Deng - Python and fluid mechanics

- grad student at UWaterloo
- use the PIV (particle image velocimetry) file format
- typically use Lavision software, then use numpy.ndarray for post-processing
- built PyPostPiv package (load as Field 2D instance)
  - https://github.com/hujc91/PyPostPiv

## Alex Petralia - Hard technical skills for research and business analysts

- worked as biz analyst at consulting company
- learned how to automate web scraping to get required data for economic analysis
- exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning
- have a research hypothesis and wrangle data 
  - then further analysis and visualization of data
- then sanity checking after all this - look for anomalies and outliers
- takeaways:
  - need data skepticism - of yours and other's data
  - need full-stack data analysis - employ an engineering/software dev mindset

## Shelly DeForte - Use machine learning for biology

- studies protein sequences using Python
- most AI/ML has been about images/video recognition - little done for biology
- scikit-learn - good at neural networks
- keras (uses theano or tensorflow) - only works on neural networks
- uses BioPython - used to parse "fasta" files

## David Wolever - Postgres, MVCC, Why COUNT(\*) is slow

- SQL is declarative language - i.e. describe what you want
- Python is imperative - i.e. series of steps are described
- therefore to diagnose SQL need to figure out steps it's taking
- http://use-the-index-luke.com/
- in psql, use EXPLAIN to see cost of a query
- MVCC - multi version concurrency control 
  - PostgreSQL uses transactions - i.e. BEGIN and COMMIT
- when psql writes to disk, the rows are immutable
  - when UPDATE occurs, it writes new row
  - psql uses XID to track which is newest row(s) - i.e. creates xmin and xmax column on each row
- table's row count depends on current transaction and there can be many transactions
- psql's VACUUM removes the rows that are invisible - i.e. xmax < any current transaction
- potential of transaction ID wrap around if don't run vacuum

## Jesse Shapiro - Descriptors, magic methods, etc.

- "magic" methods (AKA "dunder" methods) are promises to user 
  - e.g. __str__, __init__

## Keynote: Mariatta Wijaya - PEP498 The Monologue

- Python Enhancement Protocol (PEP)
- there are 450 PEPs; 88 were rejected
- PEP498 includes briefer string format (e.g. f"string {var}") 
- documentation is found under "formatted string literal"
- f-string available on Python 3.6
